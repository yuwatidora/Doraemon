# Doraemon

This is an exercise to learn object oriented programming and using the pygame library. 
In the code, the user is allowed to interact with the Doraemon sprite using the up, down keys and make it move up and down across the street. 
Multiple sprite images and frames were used to make Doraemon appear to be walking naturally.
